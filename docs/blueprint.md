## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, grounded blue (#34669A), conveying professionalism, trust, and confidence. Its hue is inspired by concepts of reliability, authority, and skill. Teal is deliberately avoided, as per instructions.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E0E8EF), creating a calm, professional backdrop that keeps the focus on the resume content.
- Accent color: A vibrant orange (#D98829) analogous to the primary blue, that offers a pop of energy, distinguishing key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, to lend a machined, neutral, modern feel.
- Professional, crisp icons to represent resume sections and actions.
- Clean, well-spaced layout emphasizing readability.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to maintain user engagement.
